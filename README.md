## Project Info

All the features implemented in this project are as follows: 
The core logic can be found in [FaceDetect > facedetect.py]

+ FaceDetect has been implemented and packaged as a class to be imported for usage.
+ The framework allows reading images, videos and webcam streams in 2 ways: 
    1. By providing settings dictionary to the constructor and adjust the native features
    2. By extending the FaceDetect class to create more features
+ Face Detection has been implemented for several media. The faces can now be detected in images, videos and live webcams
+ Ability to either draw rectangles around the detections or print them to the console has been implemented
+ The framework can:
+ extract detected faces into separate individual images
+ detect facial features and draw them on top of either medium
+ recognize faces in a video, webcam or image based on known faces provided as image inputs
+ identify recognized faces visually in a video, webcam or image
+ access detection and recognition data through other programs
